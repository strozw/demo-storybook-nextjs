# Demo App for Next.js with Storybook

## Outline

This demo uses Next.js 15 and React 19 RC to set up a Storybook in `@storybook/nextjs`, with `@storybook/experimental-addon-test` and `vite-plugin-storybook- nextjs` to allow vitest to test components using `*.stories.tsx` and the nextjs API.

### Why not use `@storybook/experimental-nextjs-vite`?

Currently, @storybook/experimental-nextjs-vite` does not support React 19 for rendering storybooks in the browser.
Therefore, I use`@storybook/nextjs`and mock the Next.js API when running vitest on`vite-plugin-storybook-nextjs`.
